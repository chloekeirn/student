Bunbun and Peach are my two pets! Bunbun's a 7 year old rabbit, and Peach is a 4 month old puppy we got over the summer. Below are pretty impressive stick figures of my brothers, as well as a paintbrush to show how much I love making art! I've been playing volleyball since I was 8 years old, and currently play for Del Norte. I was born in Illinois, specifically Chicago, and lived there until I moved here to San Diego when I began first grade. As shown in the bottom drawings, I like to play games in my free time and raise plants!</font></p>
